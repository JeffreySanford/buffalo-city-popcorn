# Poppy Mascot & Seasonal Theming

## Overview
Poppy the Buffalo is Buffalo City Popcorn’s young, female mascot and the heart of the brand’s playful, premium identity. Poppy is a spirited entrepreneur, running her own popcorn business in Jamestown, ND, and her look, personality, and animations change with the seasons, holidays, and local events.

## Visual Style & Personality
- **Style:** Vintage 1940s cartoon (Looney Tunes/Disney), expressive, friendly, and approachable.
- **Attire:** Poppy’s outfit changes for each season, major holiday (Valentine’s, July 4th, etc.), and special events (e.g., Medora Museum Week). Examples:
  - Spring: Prairie dress, wildflower crown
  - Summer: Popcorn vendor apron, sunglasses, baseball cap
  - Fall: Plaid scarf, boots, harvest basket
  - Winter: Cozy sweater, earmuffs, holiday scarf
  - Special: Cowgirl hat for Medora, heart-themed for Valentine’s, etc.
- **Color Palette:** Brand colors (burgundy, amber, cream, brown, blue, Dakota Rose) with seasonal accents.
- **Personality:** Young, energetic, entrepreneurial, welcoming, and a little mischievous.

## Brand Role
- **Ambassador:** Guides users, celebrates achievements, and appears in onboarding, popups, and seasonal banners.
- **Gamification:** Central to “Poppy Points,” badges, leaderboards, and progress indicators—her look and animations reflect user progress and seasonal events.
- **Storytelling:** Poppy’s changing outfits and moods help tell the story of Jamestown, ND, and connect users to local heritage and events.

## Seasonal & Event-Driven Theming
- **Material Design 3 Integration:**
  - The site’s MD3 theme (colors, shapes, animations) changes with the seasons and special days, always anchored in the brand palette.
  - Subtle background animations (falling leaves, snow, fireworks, etc.) accompany Poppy’s outfit changes.
  - Theming and mascot changes are coordinated for seamless, accessible transitions.
- **Local & Cultural Events:**
  - Poppy’s look and the site theme adapt for Medora’s Museum Week, ND rodeos, and other regional celebrations.
  - Special animations and UI elements highlight local history and holidays.

## Expansion Ideas
- **Sidekicks:** Prairie Dog Pete, a 1940s pin-up cowgirl, or caricatured local legends (e.g., Teddy Roosevelt) can join Poppy for special events.
- **User Customization:** Users could unlock or vote for new outfits and themes as part of gamification.

## UI Integration
- Poppy appears in onboarding, achievement popups, seasonal banners, and as a guide for new features.
- Her moods and expressions change to match user actions and the time of year.
- All mascot and theming changes are implemented using MD3’s theming and animation capabilities for consistency and accessibility.

## Poppy as Animated, Sassy Chatbot
Poppy the Buffalo is not only the brand mascot but also the site’s interactive chatbot. She answers who, what, when, where, and how questions in a sassy, playful tone, with responses and animations that change with the season, holiday, or event. Audio interactivity is supported, allowing Poppy to speak and react expressively. This makes help and support fun, memorable, and always on-brand.

- Poppy’s chatbot persona is coordinated with her visual style and seasonal outfits.
- The chatbot is accessible, engaging, and leverages Material Design 3 for seamless integration.
